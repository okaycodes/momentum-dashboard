# challenge25-momentum dashboard clone

The momentum dashboard clone is a clone of the popular browser extension and is built working with at least data from three different apis. The purpose of this project is to
demonstrate working with both external APIs and internal APIs

When creating a web extension, extensive knowledge of the
internal browser api is required.

## setup

This project was created as a firefox browser extension.
You can either view this extension rendered as a simple
html page on https://okaycodes.github.io/momentum-dashboard/
or download the repo and run the extension on chrome in debug
mode.
